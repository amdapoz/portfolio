<p> <a class="underline" href="https://www.mitsolar.com/" target="_blank"> MIT SEVT </a> has been around since the 1980s and builds solar powered cars for long-distance races. Designed to be efficient, the cars are experimental vehicles which allow team members to learn hands-on engineering from the start of their MIT careers. </p>

<p> I was a member of the Aerodynamics & Composites subteam and served as subteam lead in 2020/2021. Our subteam was in charge of the vehicle's monocoque, including both the aeroshell and interior chassis as well as any additional composite components. I managed and completed much of Nimbus's compsoite manufacturing and developed new manufacturing processes for the team, including custom moldmaking and accessory installation which saved costs while achieving the desired designs. </p>

<p> In addition, I focused on improving our aerodynamic simulations. Wind tunnel results did not match the previous simulations, showing errors in our process. I worked at learning and teaching new CFD (computational fluid dynamics) methods to aid in the development of the team's next car. I still stay in contact with the team and participate as an alum mentor, attending design reviews and providing feedback on their current projects. </p>
