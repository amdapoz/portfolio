  overview: "ReefScan Deep is a towed AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) I designed whihle spending a summer as a visiting researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Since then, the team at AIMS built and deployed the vehicle on the Great Barrier Reef."

<p>ReefScan Deep is designed to be towed behind a boat for simplicity of deployment while stabilizing itself and semi-autonomously positing it in the water column. The device is designed for 10-80m depth as an alternative to boat mounted solutions. One of my main goals was designing a hydrodynamically stable vehicle as AIMS's attempts to use a commercial ROV for deep water surveys caused the thrusters to brown out. To solve this I created a mathematical model of the vehicle used to optimize vehicle paramaters. I also developed a custom frame and pressure vessel to house the electronics, especially the oddly-shaped camera and optical dome which meant a standard pressure vessel could not be utilized. Finally, a newa battery-exchange system allows AIMS to conduct longer surveys. To see the other ReefScan devices and read about the project in genera, check out [AIMS's website]lian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). It is a part of their [ReefScan series](https://www.aims.gov.au/research/technology/reefscan). </p>
