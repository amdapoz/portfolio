project:
  title: "ReefScan Deep"
  type: "AIMS Internship"
  logo: "/assets/images/projects/reefscan/reefscan-logo.png"
  overview: "ReefScan Deep is a TAUV (towed autonomous underwater vehicle) I designed while spending a summer as a visiting researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in 2022. Since then, the team at AIMS built and deployed the vehicle on the Great Barrier Reef, helping them monitor invasive crown-of-thorns starfish."

<p>I designed the vehicle as a TAUV to keep simplicity of boat-mounted devices while being able to image deeper water (10-80m). A boat provides the forward speed while the vehicle's four thrusters allow it to semi-autonomously position depth in the water column and stabilize the vehicle to ensure high-quality photo and video.

One of my main goals was to design a hydrodynamically stable vehicle as AIMS's previous attempts to use a commercial ROV for deep water surveys failed due to forces on the tether pulled the ROV back to the surface. I resolved this issue through a custom hydrofoil and careful positioning and selection of vehicle paramaters, such as buoyancy and center of mass, which were optimized through a mathematical model of ReefScan Deep.

I also developed a custom frame and pressure vessel to house the electronics, especially as the oddly-shaped camera and optical dome which meant a standard pressure vessel could not be used. Finally, a new battery-exchange system allows AIMS to conduct longer surveys.
