project:
  title: "ReefScan Deep"
  type: "AIMS Internship"
  logo: "/assets/images/projects/reefscan/reefscan-logo.png"
  overview: "ReefScan Deep is a TAUV (towed autonomous underwater vehicle) I designed while spending a summer as a visiting researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in 2022. Since then, the team at AIMS built and deployed the vehicle on the Great Barrier Reef, helping them monitor invasive crown-of-thorns starfish."

<p>I designed the vehicle as a TAUV to keep simplicity of boat-mounted devices while being able to image deeper water (10-80m). A boat provides the forward speed while the vehicle's four thrusters provide depth control and stabilize the vehicle to ensure high-quality photo and video. </p>
&#13;
<p>One of my main goals was to design a hydrodynamically stable vehicle as AIMS's previous attempts to use a commercial ROV for deep water surveys failed. To create ReefScan Deep, I made a mathematical model to optimize vehicle paramaters and designed vehicle elements based on the results. Finally, I also developed a custom frame, electronics canister, and battery-exchange system. </p>
